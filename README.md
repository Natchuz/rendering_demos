# Rendering demos

**README WIP**

In this repo I'd like to build a renderer (in vuklan, dx12 possibly later) showcasing modern techniques I've already learned and will learn onward.

Currently stuck learning Vulkan, nothing besides blank screen here (with number of validation layers complaining about something).
